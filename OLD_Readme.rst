Braindecode
===========

A deep learning toolbox to decode raw time-domain EEG.

For EEG researchers that want to want to work with deep learning and
deep learning researchers that want to work with EEG data.
For now focussed on convolutional networks.


Installation
============

1. Install pytorch from http://pytorch.org/ (you don't need to install torchvision).

2. Install numpy (necessary for resamply installation to work), e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install numpy

3. Install braindecode from github:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install https://github.com/TNTLFreiburg/braindecode/archive/master.zip
